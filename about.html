                        This project was so much fun to do. Although I spent way to many all-nighters on it, I will never forget it. 
                        I learned so much from this project and got a taste of a new realm of computer science: Game Development. From 
                        this project I gained: A decompoitional mindset, experience in Canvas.js, an introduction to recursion, more 
                        experience with OOP (Object Oriented Programming) and many new skills in CSS & front-end development. I 
                        can't wait to look back at this project when I'm older, and reminicse on the good memories I've had grinding  
                        these games out & looking forward to presenting it at Code Next. This project acts as a time chamber for me. 
                        It will help me in never forgeting my childhood and the way I was raised. I hope it does the same for you.
